# Patent-Sorting-Algorithm-Debugging-Script-Python

This is a python script I wrote for debugging the patent sorting machine learning algorithm written about in (Morrison et al. 2017). The algorithm had recently had changes made to take on a larger dataset that included more recent patents which needed structural changes to how the algorithm dealt with short names in densely populated areas. After making these changes, the algorithm's sucess rate dropped by nearly 30%. This goal of writing this script was to identify which areas of the algorithm were making errors.
